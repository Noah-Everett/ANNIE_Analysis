# **ANNIE_Analysis**
 
## Directory Naming Convention
`<version of ANNIE geometry>_<top volume>_<number of identical runs>_<events per run>_<other run specific information>/`

Im sure there are better convensions I could have used but this was basically the first think I thought of. I'll probably change it later.
